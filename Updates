# 🌱 Detection and Management of Vegetation with Anomalies  
## Multi-Agent System – 

---

 Project Overview

This project develops a **Multi-Agent System (MAS)** for the detection and management of anomalies in **tomato crops** inside a **simulated greenhouse**

Autonomous agents collaborate to:

- Detect early signs of anomalies (diseases, nutrient deficiencies, pests, stress).
- Analyze and classify anomalies according to severity.
- Decide and dispatch corrective actions such as treatment or inspection.
- Coordinate their navigation to avoid **traffic jams** inside the greenhouse.

The simulation focuses on **autonomy, coordination, and collaborative problem solving** to support better crop management.

## System Architecture 

The system is composed of four main agents:

- **Detection Agent** – Reactive agent that scans plants and detects anomalies.
- **Analysis Agent** – Deliberative BDI agent that validates and classifies anomalies.
- **Decision Agent** – Hybrid agent that integrates information and selects actions.
- **Action Agent** – Reactive executor (robots/drones) that performs physical actions in Unity.

💡 3. Lessons Learned (Team Reflections)
1️⃣ Early Modeling Prevents Major Rework

Creating the MAS architecture early guided Unity development and avoided costly structural refactors.

2️⃣ Agent Communication Was More Complex Than Expected

Designing the Detection → Analysis → Decision → Action flow required precise responsibility mapping.

3️⃣ Unity & MAS Logic Progress at Different Speeds

Unity visuals were fast to create, but integrating MAS reasoning and data flow demanded close coordination.

4️⃣ Time Estimates Improve With Practice

Initial tasks involving BDI modeling and anomaly mapping were underestimated, but later estimates became more accurate.

5️⃣ Diagrams Greatly Reduce Miscommunication

AUML sequence diagrams and state machines helped the team fully understand each agent’s behavior and interactions.

6️⃣ Collaboration Was Essential

Distributing work across diagrams, programming, modeling, and Unity allowed steady progress despite varying workloads.
